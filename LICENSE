TL;DR: Do whatever you want. Print it out and use it as toilet paper if that's
      what makes you happy. I truly, genuinely, do not give a single damn.

MONEY CLAUSE: If you somehow make money off this shit, I want a percentage 
              determined by two fair rolls of dice, expressed as a percentage.
              Roll 2d6, add them up, that's my cut. (So between 2% and 12%)
              
              Example: You roll a 4 and a 3, you owe me 7% of profits.
              
              This is legally binding* (*not actually legally binding, but 
              it would be pretty cool if you did it anyway).
